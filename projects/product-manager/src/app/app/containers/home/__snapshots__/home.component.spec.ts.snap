      Please start by perfoming a wonderful fake search.

    <br />
    <p

      The API only returns 20 items...
    </p>
    <br />
    <p
      class="home__paragraph"
    >
      ...and they are all totally different from each other.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p
      class="home__paragraph"
    >
      Meaning any actual search would return only 1 element.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p
      class="home__paragraph"

       We prefer to peform a fake search to be able to sort the results later. 
    </p>
    <br />
    <p
      class="home__paragraph"

      So just type anything and hit Enter.

      Have fun!
